A Ruby wrapper for the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/).

Provides a simple and intuitive interface for the Movie Database API making use of OpenStruct.

Get your API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account).

## Getting started

#### Install inside Rails app

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'themoviedb-api'
```
#### Install outside Rails app

```ruby
gem install themoviedb-api
```

## Initial Configuration

If you are using this gem in a Rails application you can set the following parameters in an initializer.

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.key("KEY_HERE")
```

You can change the language for the returned data with this:

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.language("en")
```

The default language is english.

You can temporarily override global language for one request by specifying the language as an additional parameter in the method called.  

```ruby
# Example
Tmdb::Movie.detail(550, language: 'it')
```

Every method can be called with additional parameters if needed, for further information see [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/).

```ruby
# Example
Tmdb::Search.movie('terminator', page: 2, language: 'it')
```

This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.
To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL.

```ruby
config = Tmdb::Configuration.get
