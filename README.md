A Ruby wrapper for the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/).

Provides a simple and intuitive interface for the Movie Database API making use of OpenStruct.

Get your API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account).

## Getting started

### Install inside Rails app

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'themoviedb-api'
```
### Install outside Rails app

```ruby
gem install themoviedb-api
```

## Initial Configuration

If you are using this gem in a Rails application you can set the following parameters in an initializer.

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.key("KEY_HERE")
```

You can change the language for the returned data with this:

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.language("en")
```

The default language is english.

You can temporarily override global language for one request by specifying the language as an additional parameter in the method called.  

```ruby
# Ex.
Tmdb::Movie.detail(550, language: 'it')
```

## Configuration

Get the system wide configuration information. Some elements of the API require some knowledge of this configuration data.
This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.
To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL.

```ruby
config = Tmdb::Configuration.get

# Response
Tmdb::Configuration {
         :images => Tmdb::Configuration {
               :base_url => "http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/",

# Retrieve images base url example
base_url = config.images.base_url
```

## Certifications

### Movie List

Get the list of supported certifications for movies. These can be used in conjunction with the certification_country and certification.lte parameters when using discover.

```ruby
Tmdb::Certification.movie_list
```

### TV List

```ruby
Tmdb::Certification.tv_list

## Changes

### Movie

```ruby
Tmdb::Change.movie
```

### Person
