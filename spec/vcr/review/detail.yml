        thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.\r\n\r\nWhilst
        some think the film is too long for the story I didn''t find this. The length
        of the film is longer than some (but doesn''t feel it), I liked that the film
        took it''s time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed
        to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed
        and calm before the final crescendo).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day whether
        you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has
        directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman series so far.\r\n\r\nStupendously
        good film in my opinion.","iso_639_1":"en","media_id":49026,"media_title":"The
