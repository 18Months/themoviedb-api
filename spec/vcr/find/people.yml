        Bill","overview":"The Bill is a police procedural television series that was
        broadcast on the ITV network from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010. The
        programme originated from a one-off drama, entitled Woodentop, which was broadcast
        in August 1983. In its final year on air, The Bill was broadcast once a week,
        usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays, in a one-hour format. The programme focused
        on the lives and work of one shift of police officers, rather than on any
        particular aspect of police work. At the time of the series'' conclusion,
        The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the
        United Kingdom, and was among the longest-running of any British television
        series. The series was produced by Thames Television. The series name originated
        from \"Old Bill\", a slang term for the police. This was also Geoff McQueen''s
        original title idea for the series, before he eventually decided on \"The
        Bill\".\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed amongst fans and critics alike, the series
        attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was
        criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, and another
        episode in the same year resulted in litigation, submitted by MP George Galloway
        for defamation. The series has also faced more general criticism, concerning
        the levels of violence it portrays, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied
        a pre-watershed slot. During its time on air, The Bill won several awards,
        including BAFTAs, a Writers'' Guild of Great Britain award and the title of
        \"best drama\" at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009, the latter being the series''
        fourth consecutive win. Throughout its twenty-seven-year run, the programme
        was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of
        the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast. The series has
        also been repeated on other digital stations, including UKTV Gold, Alibi,
        Watch and UKTV G2. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network
        did not intend to recommission The Bill, and that filming on the series would
        cease on 14 June 2010. The last ever episode of the series was aired on 31
        August 2010.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"/3Pa3nrW5oxkmWI0cdunbqFaEcdo.jpg","popularity":1.182992,"name":"The
