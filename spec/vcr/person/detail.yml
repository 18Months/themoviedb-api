        the most important film innovator in the history of the medium, George Lucas
        continually \"pushed the envelope\" of filmmaking technology since his early
        days as a student at U.S.C. Considered a wunderkind by his contemporaries,
        he had a much harder time communicating his vision to studio executives, whose
        meddling managed to compromise each of his first three feature directing efforts
        in some way. The monumental success of \"Star Wars\" (1977) ushered in the
        era of the \"summer blockbuster,\" which, despite the later popularity of
        low budget independent films, was still the prevailing mentality powering
        the Hollywood engine.\n\nThough he set the tone and established the expectations
        which influenced studios to devote the bulk of their resources to films designed
        to blast off into hyperspace for spectacular profits, it was doubtful that
        a film as revolutionary as \"Star Wars\" was in its day could get made in
        the later blockbuster assembly line climate of the new millennium.","birthday":"1944-05-14","deathday":"","homepage":"","id":1,"imdb_id":"nm0000184","name":"George
